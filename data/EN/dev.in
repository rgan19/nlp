Loved
it

The
music
playing
was
very
hip
,
20-30
something
pop
music
,
but
the
subwoofer
to
the
sound
system
was
located
under
my
seat
,
which
became
annoying
midway
through
dinner
.

This
place
has
ruined
me
for
neighborhood
sushi
.

I
have
never
eaten
in
the
restaurant
,
however
,
upon
reading
the
reviews
I
got
take
out
last
week
.

It
isn't
the
cheapest
sushi
but
has
been
worth
it
every
time
.

To
sum
it
up
:
Service
varies
from
good
to
mediorce
,
depending
on
which
waiter
you
get
;
generally
it
is
just
average
Ok
.

Dungeness
crabs
here
!

We
called
the
other
person
who
was
very
close
by
,
and
she
told
us
to
order
for
her
,
so
we
did
.

Went
there
with
my
wife
and
we
had
to
wait
for
a
table
even
though
you
could
see
there
many
that
were
empty
with
not
reservation
sigh
on
them
.

-
Mediocre
Service
/
Quality

The
reason
there
are
4
different
results
on
citysearch
for
the
same
place
is
because
they
keep
trying
to
start
a
new
thread
so
they
can
stock
it
with
positive
reviews
.

I'd
go
back
there
in
a
heartbeat
.

We
asked
for
beverages
and
never
received
them
.

A
gentleman
,
maybe
the
manager
,
came
to
our
table
,
and
without
so
much
as
a
smile
or
greeting
asked
for
our
order
.

Great
Indian
Food
!

cirspy
crust
margherita
pizza

My
friends
spoke
so
much
about
it
for
months
,
I
finally
made
the
time
to
come
down
ear
and
dine
in
.

Can't
wait
to
go
back
.

We
were
fast
to
order
the
appetizer
platter
since
we
were
very
hungry
.

best
honey
walnyt
prawns
that
we
have
every
tasted
.

The
price
is
reasonable
although
the
service
is
poor
.

Freshest
sushi
–
I
love
this
restaurant
.

Someone
else
recommended
the
dessert
-
we
also
left
that
.

This
place
is
the
most
Japanese
it
can
ever
get
.

I
honestly
don't
even
know
where
to
begin
.

The
food
was
well
prepared
and
the
service
impecable
.

THE
BIG
COMPLAINT
:
NO
TOASTING
AVAILABLE
.

Have
the
iced
tea
.

It's
cuz
it's
so
good
you
need
to
taste
it
!
!
!

While
their
kitchen
food
is
delicious
,
their
Sushi
is
out
of
this
world
.

Good
for
late
night
dining
(
last
minute
planning
)
without
reservations
.

Went
to
Cafe
Spice
with
4
of
my
friends
on
a
saturday
night
.

For
each
course
we
waited
over
1/2
hour
to
45
minutes
and
were
never
offered
a
drink
.

melt
in
your
mouth
.

There
are
so
many
other
great
places
to
go
to
eat
and
drink
...
this
place
is
not
worth
it
...

I've
been
to
at
Cafe
Spice
probably
5-8
times
,
it
is
probably
still
the
best
Indian
restaurant
around
Union
Square
.

The
real
problem
I
had
with
this
place
was
the
complete
lack
of
service
.

When
I
got
there
the
place
was
packed
but
they
made
sure
to
seat
me
quickly
.

Sometimes
you
pay
a
lot
and
don't
get
much
in
return
-
it's
manhattan
,
things
are
expensive
.

We
had
a
very
hard
time
getting
the
waitress
'
attention
and
finally
had
to
get
up
and
go
inside
to
speak
to
a
manager
.

How
is
this
palce
still
open
?

The
best
place
for
a
leisure
Sunday
breakfast
amidst
yachts
,
then
take
a
stroll
through
the
nearby
Farmer's
Market
.

Give
it
a
try
and
enjoy
.

I
just
don't
understand
all
the
hype
...

Small
servings
for
main
entree
,
i
had
salmon
(
wasnt
impressed
)
girlfriend
had
chicken
,
it
was
good
.

This
is
a
nice
restaurant
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
place
to
host
an
intimate
dinner
meeting
with
business
associates
.

The
floor
was
wet
,
the
trash
can
filled
with
hand
towels
n
all
over
the
floor
,
no
soap
,
and
no
hand
towels
left
.

The
flavors
are
amazing
and
the
value
is
phenomenal
.

Most
importantly
,
we
were
so
excited
about
the
food
after
seeing
the
very
creative
menu
.

The
mussles
were
the
fishiest
things
I've
ever
tasted
,
the
seabass
was
bland
,
the
goat
cheese
salad
was
missing
the
goat
cheese
,
the
penne
w
/
chicken
had
bones
in
it
...
It
was
disgusting
.

After
one
member
of
our
party
had
been
bumped
repeatedly
by
a
waitress
,
a
polite
request
that
he
not
be
bumped
sent
the
waitress
into
an
abusive
rant
.

It's
great
to
go
for
a
quick
lunch
either
alone
or
with
a
friend
.

The
first
time
I
went
,
and
was
completely
taken
by
the
live
jazz
band
and
atmosphere
,
I
ordered
the
Lobster
Cobb
Salad
.

I've
been
many
time
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.

While
I
could
have
done
without
the
youth
who
shared
the
evening
with
us
,
our
wonderful
server
and
food
made
the
experience
a
very
positive
one
.

The
service
is
fantastic
at
this
fun
place
.

I
had
their
eggs
benedict
for
brunch
,
which
were
the
worst
in
my
entire
life
,
I
tried
removing
the
hollondaise
sauce
completely
that
was
how
failed
it
was
.

The
house
special
roll
is
really
good
.

BUT
not
in
a
good
way
.

The
entertainment
was
great
they
have
shows
that
go
on
through
out
the
dinner
.

On
a
recent
Sunday
afternoon
,
a
friend
and
I
accidently
found
this
great
restaurant
on
our
way
to
see
the
pulitzer
prize
winning
play
DOUBT
.

keep
up
the
good
work
.

You
never
feel
icky
and
stuffed
after
you
eat
there
.

I
highly
recommend
visiting
this
restaurant
and
having
dinner
and
drinks
!

There
is
only
one
place
on
the
east
coast
that
has
it
all
,
plus
a
lot
more
.

Its
great
if
you
spent
the
day
there
and
didn't
want
to
drive
to
eat
.

The
food
is
good
,
especially
their
more
basic
dishes
,
and
the
drinks
are
delicious
.

What's
the
difference
between
the
two
?

(
She
was
actually
going
to
take
me
to
another
mediterranean
restaurant
right
across
the
street
but
they
were
not
open
yet
even
though
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
their
opening
time
.
)

Definitely
a
neighborhood
favorite
.

I
was
one
of
the
people
that
went
for
this
horrible
experience
.

She
then
put
the
check
down
without
asking
if
we
were
done
,
and
came
to
check
on
the
bill
every
two
minutes
,
even
though
we
were
one
of
three
occupied
tables
.

Consequently
,
their
burgers
fell
apart
in
their
hands
and
made
such
a
mess
that
they
did'nt
feel
like
finishing
them
.

–
A
sushi-fiend
friend
recently
visited
and
our
group
of
three
just
had
to
come
for
dinner
.

Salads
are
a
delicious
way
to
begin
the
meal
.

Whose
writing
all
the
great
reviews
?

Small
,
bright
,
and
clean
,
BZ
Grill
stands
apart
from
the
usual
run
of
gyro
joints
,
both
in
Astoria
and
out
.

They
have
been
featured
on
the
food
network
and
they
deserve
it
.

Tiny
dessert
was
$
8.00
...
just
plain
overpriced
for
what
it
is
.

The
portions
are
HUGE
,
so
it
might
be
good
to
order
three
things
to
split
(
rather
than
one
appetizer
and
entree
per
person
)
for
two
people
.

The
food
is
great
and
they
have
a
good
selecion
of
wines
at
reasonable
prices
.

–
Not
bad
.

The
frizzy
retro
girl
(
with
winged
/
Dame
Edna
glasses
)
will
yell
at
you
if
you
try
to
order
a
drink
.

Looking
around
,
I
saw
a
room
full
of
New
Yorkers
enjoying
a
real
meal
in
a
real
restaurant
,
not
a
clubhouse
of
the
fabulous
trying
to
be
seen
.

But
who
says
Murray's
is
anything
about
service
.

Food
was
OK
.

My
wife
and
I
visited
Dokebi
tonight
.

Prefer
to
order
it
and
pick
it
up
though
because
I
don't
like
the
servers
,
one
young
woman
in
particular
.

Though
it's
been
crowded
most
times
I've
gone
here
,
Bark
always
delivers
on
their
food
.

Yes
,
it
is
good
,
but
I've
had
better
for
cheaper
.

Maybe
it
is
good
for
that
one
night
once
in
a
blue
moon
when
the
chefs
decide
to
use
fish
that's
half-way
decent
.

And
it
was
quick
which
is
very
important
.

They
wouldnt
even
let
me
finish
my
glass
of
wine
before
offering
another
.

All
the
various
Greek
and
Cypriot
dishes
are
excellent
,
but
the
gyro
is
the
reason
to
come--if
you
don't
eat
one
your
trip
was
wasted
.

I
was
there
for
brunch
recently
,
and
we
were
tag
teamed
by
a
waitress
and
a
waiter
.

Amazing
food
.

Even
though
its
good
seafood
,
the
prices
are
too
high
.

Great
place
,
great
value
.

not
only
is
the
food

this
place
had
ALL
the
trimmings
and
i
mean
all
.

great
beer

lobster
was
good
,
nothing
spectacular
.

They
are
opening
two
more
places
as
i
saw
a
flyer
there
one
in
Yonkers
which
is
a
restraunt
and
banquet
hall
and
another
one
in
parsipanny
new
jersey
.

However
,
the
value
and
service
are
both
severely
lacking
.

However
,
this
place
is
a
gem
,
and
I
won't
stop
going
back
.

I
cannot
imagine
better
Indian
food
in
all
of
the
city
.

Much
more
reasonably
priced
too
!

next
one
that
we
ordered
were
prawns
and
scallop
with
brocolli
.

Suan
is
a
great
place
that
I
often
take
my
friends
(
classmates
)
too
.

Can't
argue
about
that
,
but
they
are
clearly
over
priced
.

We
won't
go
to
this
place
again
for
a
good
meal
.

The
pizza
itself
is
not
exactly
the
best
I've
had
EVER
,
but
still
pretty
good
.

They
charge
different
prices
all
the
time
.

Need
I
say
more
?

Also
a
little
more
expensive
than
your
average
bagel
place
.

Two
thumbs
up
!

I'll
be
back
for
sure
.

It's
just
average
,
just
shredded
,
no
seasoning
on
it
.

It's
unpretentious
and
underground
.

it's
delicious
!

A
restaurant
that
doesn't
try
to
do
anything
except
serve
great
food
with
great
service
in
a
pleasant
atmosphere
.

Appetizers
took
nearly
an
hour
.

Chow
fun
was
dry
;
pork
shu
mai
was
more
than
usually
greasy
and
had
to
share
a
table
with
loud
and
rude
family
.

We
had
a
very
nice
time
.

My
six
year
old
loved
it
.

If
you
like
spicy
food
get
the
chicken
vindaloo
.

This
place
,
which
is
only
a
few
months
old
,
is
perhaps
Queens
'
biggest
secret
!

it
is
not
consistent
.

He
has
visited
Thailand
and
is
quite
expert
on
the
cuisine
.

For
the
amount
of
food
we
got
the
prices
should
have
been
lower
.

i
actually
feel
like
i
should
keep
it
a
secret
.

The
quantity
is
also
very
good
,
you
will
come
out
satisfied
.

All
in
all
,
I
would
return
-
as
it
was
a
beautiful
restaurant
-
but
I
hope
the
staff
pays
more
attention
to
the
little
details
in
the
future
.

The
view
is
spectacular
,
and
the
food
is
great
.

the
food
was
great
,
the
margaritas
too
but
the
waitress
was
too
busy
being
nice
to
her
other
larger
party
than
to
take
better
care
of
my
friend
and
me
.

We
both
opted
for
a
pasta
dish
and
they
were
served
timely
and
fresh
.

Excellent

Our
visit
their
to
say
the
least
,
was
an
unpleasant
and
costly
experience
!

Price
and
quality
of
fish
alone
will
keep
us
from
making
a
return
visit
.

There
is
a
downside
if
you're
ordering
in
-
-
the
delivery
guys
have
MAJOR
attitude
.

big
thick
pepperoni

Worth
visiting
the
1st
Ave
spot
because
it
is
the
original
store
.

This
place
has
the
best
Chinese
style
BBQ
ribs
in
the
city
.

Perfection
.

Best
drumsticks
over
rice
and
sour
spicy
soup
in
town
!

The
wine
list
is
also
really
nice
.

The
only
thing
more
wonderful
than
the
food
(
which
is
exceptional
)
is
the
service
.

The
food
is
okay
and
the
prices
here
are
mediocre
.

No
desert
menu
,
no
apology
,
nothing
!
!
!

believe
us
,
we've
been
eating
sushi
for
over
15
yrs
.

Doesn't
get
any
better
than
that
.

The
only
beverage
we
did
receive
was
water
in
dirty
glasses
!

The
lunch
menu
is
an
awesome
deal
!

I
ordered
the
smoked
salmon
and
roe
appetizer
and
it
was
off
flavor
.

I
don't
know
why
anyone
would
want
to
write
a
great
review
about
this
place
.

You
will
not
be
disapointed
at
all
.

This
is
a
twenty-something
guy
that
doesn't
mind
laying
down
$
300
for
a
fine
and
delicious
meal
for
2
on
special
occassions
.

I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
gem
in
Hoboken
.

Personally
I
like
the
margherita
pizza
better
,
but
they
are
all
good
.

Will
never
be
back
.

When
you
add
it
all
together
,
it
just
doesn't
seem
worth
it
to
me
...
especially
considering
the
prices
.

So
rude
!
!
!

The
Cypriot
restaurant
has
a
lot
going
for
it
.

I
found
the
food
,
service
and
value
exceptional
everytime
I
have
been
there
.

The
anti-pasta
was
excellent
,
especially
the
calamari
,
as
were
the
filling
pasta
mains
.

Caesar
salad
was
superb
.

This
was
2
times
what
the
same
meal
would
have
cost
at
Le
Peep
.

I
can
highly
recommend
their
various
saag
and
paneer
and
korma
.

Baluchi's
has
solid
food
and
a
nice
decor
at
reasonable
prices
.

Yes
,
the
place
is
classy
and
beautiful
,
but
they
most
certainly
target
the
uber
whealthy
Not
the
common
joe
that
wants
to
go
all
out
every
once
in
a
while
.

–
I
don't
understand
how
I
was
a
stranger
to
this
place
for
so
long
...
the
fajita
salad
,
the
colorado
,
the
fajitas
-
EVERYTHING
is
delicious
.

Service
is
fast
and
friendly
.

Furthermore
,
while
the
fish
is
unquestionably
fresh
,
rolls
tend
to
be
inexplicably
bland
.

The
food
was
great
and
tasty
,
but
the
sitting
space
was
too
small
,
I
don't
like
being
cramp
in
a
corner
.

This
was
my
frist
time
at
Cafe
St
.
Bart's
and
I
must
say
how
delicous
the
food
and
the
service
was
.

I
/
we
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
again
.

We've
lived
around
the
corner
from
this
place
for
over
a
year
and
finally
had
dinner
there
.

–
This
place
is
unbelievably
over-rated
.

(
Always
ask
the
bartender
for
the
SEASONAL
beer
!
!
!

Also
,
the
sandwiches
(
nearing
$
7
)
didn't
come
with
anything
like
chips
or
a
side
.

If
there
is
a
line
very
day
of
the
week
for
the
entire
time
a
place
is
open
,
you
know
it
is
great
.

I
had
a
huge
group
for
my
birthday
and
we
were
well
taken
care
of
.

Our
teenage
kids
love
it
,
too
.

This
restaurant
was
way
overhyped
.

Her
review
is
above
.

10

Will
give
it
another
chance
before
I
write
it
off
.

The
place
is
a
BISTRO
which
means
:
simple
dishes
and
wine
served
efficiently
in
a
bustling
atmosphere
.

Authentic
Shanghai
style
and
I
cannot
recommend
a
better
Shanghai
place
in
New
York
.

I
would
highly
recommand
requesting
a
table
by
the
window
.

Terrible
Waste
of
money
..
scammers

any
further
needs
we
may
have
had
could
not
have
been
met
since
no
one
stopped
by
the
table
.

La
Rosa
waltzes
in
,
and
I
think
they
are
doing
it
the
best
.

Also
,
because
it
is
so
thin
,
it
gets
cold
very
quickly
and
its
not
that
filling
.

Should
check-up
on
us
more
frequently
,
don't
you
think
?

I
liked
the
atmosphere
very
much
but
the
food
was
not
worth
the
price
.

Fresh
ingrediants
and
super
tasty
.

Have
been
dozens
of
times
and
never
failed
to
enjoy
the
experience
.

WHAT
ELSE
CAN
YOU
SAY
NICE
PEOPLE
AMAZING
FOOD
WOW

This
was
the
perfect
quiet
,
relaxing
,
and
delicious
accompaniment
to
our
afternoon
of
theater
.

He
offers
subpar
service
and
has
no
personality
.

great
for
a
romantic
evening
,
or
a
fun
evening
with
friends
...

We
have
since
returned
and
also
had
a
great
experience
,
sampling
more
small
plates
and
a
variety
of
the
beer
(
cold
and
good
)
.

I
pray
it
stays
open
forever
.

This
restaurant
is
VEGETARIAN
;
there
are
NO
MEAT
dishes
whatsoever
.

Maggot
in
the
food
!

highly
recommended
.

Service
was
just
ok
,
it
is
not
what
you'd
expect
for
$
500
.

The
menu
is
limited
but
almost
all
of
the
dishes
are
excellent
.

As
a
student
in
NYU
i
need
a
place
to
eat
after
a
hard
day
of
work
so
usually
i
just
go
to
any
indian
restraunt
near
by
.

The
owner
truly
caters
to
all
your
needs
.

Seabass
on
lobster
risotto
was
the
best
.

The
price
very
reasonable
.

The
duck
confit
is
always
amazing
and
the
foie
gras
terrine
with
figs
was
out
of
this
world
.

My
daughter's
wedding
reception
at
Water's
Edge
received
the
highest
compliments
from
our
guests
.

$
6
and
there
is
much
tasty
food
,
all
of
it
fresh
and
continually
refilled
.

Lexicographers
take
note
:
a
new
and
fascinating
definition
of
rudeness
is
alive
and
flourishing
right
here
in
Brooklyn
.

The
service
is
good
and
ambience
is
good
for
a
date
or
group
outing
.

The
place
is
small
and
intimate
and
you
may
feel
a
little
crowded
,
but
the
service
is
excellent
and
it's
great
for
friends
out
,
a
romantic
date
,
or
a
special
occassion
.

Nice
for
one
time
special
occasion
.

–
In
a
age
of
incremental
cost
cutting
in
restaurants
,
its
nice
to
see
a
place
that
bucks
that
trend
,
and
just
plain
delivers
high
quality
food
and
good
service
,
period
.

I
have
been
going
back
again
and
again
.

By
the
time
we
left
our
wallets
were
empy
and
so
were
our
stomachs
AND
we
missed
the
show
we
were
supposed
to
see
following
our
dinner
,
which
would
have
been
acceptable
if
we
got
to
enjoy
the
experience
of
good
food
and
belly
dancers
!

We
had
fun
eating
in
there
,
we
were
there
like
around
3
a
.
m
.
in
the
morning
!

All
the
staff
is
absolutely
professional
!
!

Decor
is
nice
though
service
can
be
spotty
.

First
of
all
,
this
place
is
*
not
*
romantic
,
as
claimed
by
Citysearch's
editorial
review
.

By
far
,
the
best
pizza
in
Manhattan
.

I
won't
go
back
unless
someone
else
is
footing
the
bill
.

The
Prix
Fixe
menu
is
worth
every
penny
and
you
get
more
than
enough
(
both
in
quantity
AND
quality
)
.

Right
off
the
L
in
Brooklyn
this
is
a
nice
cozy
place
with
good
pizza
.

So
close
,
but
not
good
enough
.

Please
be
aware
that
it's
CASH
or
AMEX
only
!

Old
school
meets
New
world
.

Overall
I
would
recommend
it
and
go
back
again
.

The
waiters
are
very
experienced
and
helpful
with
pairing
your
drink
choice
to
your
food
tastes
or
vice
versa
.

Rao's
has
the
best
service
and
atmosphere
in
NYC
.

Be
prepared
to
wait
,
because
the
place
is
pretty
tiny
.

The
bathroom
itself
is
very
small
with
two
toilets
and
only
one
sink
,
the
girl
was
staying
totally
on
the
way
hanging
out
paper
towels
from
the
dispenser
.

Went
to
this
place
this
place
on
a
real
cold
night
and
needed
a
quick
meal
.

We'd
go
back
again

Have
been
several
times
and
it
never
dissapoints
.

Quite
frankly
,
this
is
some
of
the
worst
sushi
I
have
ever
tried
.

I
went
with
JWILS
.

i've
been
to
sapphire
twice
and
both
times
the
food
was
fine
,
if
not
good
.

We
were
planning
to
get
dessert
but
the
waitress
basically
through
the
bill
at
us
before
we
had
a
chance
to
order
.

The
rest
of
the
dim
sum
,
though
pricey
by
Chinatown
standards
,
is
worth
it
.

When
I
called
this
morning
,
I
didn't
think
I
would
be
able
to
get
in
at
12
,
but
I
was
able
to
get
in
,
along
with
four
other
guests
.

Love
it
.

Not
much
of
a
selection
of
bottled
beer
either
,
we
went
with
Brahma
.

There's
nice
and
quiet
,
small
but
enough
for
6
(
or
more
)
.

Don
’
t
go
to
this
place
!

To
celebrate
a
birthday
,
three
of
us
went
to
Mare
anticipating
great
food
.

Of
course
,
it
is
crowded
but
who
cares
.

Saul
is
the
best
restaurant
on
Smith
Street
and
in
Brooklyn
.

We
left
without
ever
getting
service
.

Cheese
plate
is
a
varied
delight
and
great
bargain
at
$
10
.

The
vibe
is
very
relaxed
and
cozy
,
service
was
great
and
the
food
was
excellent
!

im
not
necessarily
fanatical
about
this
place
,
but
it
was
a
fun
time
for
low
pirces
.

On
a
recent
trip
,
our
waiter
was
extremely
dismissive
,
while
no
less
than
three
staff
members
waited
hand-and-foot
on
a
pair
of
Japanese
girls
seated
nearby
.

This
place
has
totally
weird
decor
,
stairs
going
up
with
mirrored
walls
-
I
am
surprised
how
no
one
yet
broke
their
head
or
fall
off
the
stairs
-
mirrored
walls
make
you
dizzy
and
delusional
...

–
Schooner
or
Later's
charming
location
along
the
marina
in
Long
Beach
and
average
food
does
not
,
unfortunately
,
compensate
for
its
very
poor
customer
service
.

Problem
is
nothing
at
Prune
is
particularly
memorable
.

Prices
are
in
line
.

Unique
apppetizers
.

The
family
seafood
entree
was
very
good
.
