but O
the O

was O
located O
under O
my O
seat O
, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway B-negative
through O
dinner O
. O

This O
place O
has O
ruined B-negative
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi B-positive
. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O

I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

It O
isn't O
the O
cheapest B-positive
sushi I-positive
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-neutral
varies I-neutral
from O
good O
to O
mediorce B-negative
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter B-negative
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O

we O
did O

Went O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results B-neutral
on I-neutral
citysearch I-neutral
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O

so O
they O
can O
stock B-negative
it O

I've O
been O
to O
at O

5-8 B-negative
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O

around O

Square O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-positive
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O

quickly O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O

- O
it's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O

and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O

How O

I O
just O

if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host B-negative
an O

The O

are O
amazing O

the O

phenomenal O

Most O
importantly O
, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food B-positive
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O
menu O
. O

The O
mussles B-negative
were O
the O
fishiest B-negative

the O

the O

After O

by O
a O

a O

sent O
the O

into O
an O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O

The O
first O

was O

, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster B-positive

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O

the O
youth B-negative
who O
shared O
the O

with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O

and I-positive
food I-positive
made O
the O

a O
very O

one O

The O
service B-positive
is O
fantastic O
at O
this O
fun O
place O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-positive
benedict I-positive
for I-positive
brunch I-positive
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing B-negative
the I-negative
hollondaise I-negative

completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed B-negative
it O
was O
. O

The O
house B-positive
special I-positive

is O
really O
good O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O

The O

was O
great O
they O
have O

On O
a O
recent B-negative
Sunday O

You O
never O
feel B-negative
icky I-negative
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

There O
is O
only O
one O
place O
on O
the O
east B-positive
coast I-positive
that O
has O
it O
all O
, O
plus O
a O
lot O
more O
. O

Its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-neutral
dishes I-neutral
, O
and O
the O
drinks O
are O
delicious O
. O

What's B-neutral
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

( O
She O
was O
actually O
going O
to O
take O
me O
to O
another O
mediterranean B-negative
restaurant O
right O
across O
the O
street O
but O
they O
were O
not O
open O
yet O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
few O
minutes O
past O
their O
opening O
time O
. O
) O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

Consequently B-neutral
, O
their O
burgers O
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

A O

They O

Tiny B-positive

just O
plain B-negative
overpriced O

what O
it O

The O
portions B-positive

so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O

( I-positive
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer B-positive
and I-positive

) O
for O
two O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B-negative
of O

The O

Looking B-neutral
around O

I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O

enjoying O
a O
real O

in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse B-negative
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-positive
. O

Food B-neutral
was O
OK O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O
. O

Prefer B-neutral
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
I O
don't O
like O
the O
servers B-positive
, O
one O
young O
woman O
in O
particular O
. O

Though B-neutral
it's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I've O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-negative
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-positive
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue B-neutral
moon I-neutral
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish O
that's O
half-way B-negative
decent O
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

They O
wouldnt B-negative
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass B-positive
of I-positive
wine I-positive
before O
offering O
another O
. O

All O
the O
various B-neutral
Greek I-neutral
and I-neutral
Cypriot I-neutral
dishes I-neutral
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro B-negative
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come--if B-negative
you O
don't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted B-negative
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O

, O
and O
we O
were O
tag B-neutral

by O
a O
waitress B-negative

a O
waiter B-negative
. O

Amazing O
food B-positive
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-positive
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

Great O
place O
, O
great O
value O
. O

not O
only O
is O
the O
food O

this O
place O
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings B-negative
and O
i O
mean O
all O
. O

great O
beer O

lobster B-positive
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

They O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer B-negative
there O
one O
in O
Yonkers B-negative
which O
is O
a O
restraunt B-neutral
and I-neutral
banquet I-neutral

another O
one O
in O

new I-positive

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-positive
are O
both O
severely B-negative
lacking O

However O
, O
this O
place O
is O
a O
gem O
, O
and O
I O
won't O
stop O
going O
back O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive
in O
all O
of O
the O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
! O

next O
one O
that O
we O
ordered O
were O

Suan B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates B-negative
) O
too O
. O

Can't O
argue B-negative
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-positive
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
itself O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
EVER O
, O
but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Need B-neutral
I O
say O
more O
? O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O

Two O

I'll O
be O

It's O

This O

i O
