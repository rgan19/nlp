### Part 1: Features Dictionary
Calculates the transition and emission probabilities. The resulting features are stored in a dictionary

Run the following command to start training:
```
python3 part1.py [train file]
# for example
python3 part1.py data/EN/train
```

### Part 2: Viterbi Algorithm 

Run the following command to start training:
```
python3 part2.py [dictionary file from part 1] [dev.in] [dev.out]
# for example
python3 part2.py results data/EN/dev.in data/EN/dev.p2.out
```
